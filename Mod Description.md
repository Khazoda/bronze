![Getting Started](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/logo_wide.png?raw=true)

### Available for Fabric and Quilt, this mod aims to be the most vanilla-friendly bronze mod available for modern Minecraft.

Tin is a new mineable resource which can be combined with copper to create bronze, a useful metal that is slightly **better than iron**, but **worse than diamond**.

![Getting Started](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_getting_started.png?raw=true)

<img style="float: right;" src="https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/gifs/mining_tin_cut-optimized.gif?raw=true">

### Your first step is to gather some raw tin and copper.

You will need 1 <kbd>Raw Tin</kbd> and 3 <kbd>Raw Copper</kbd> for every <kbd>Bronze Ingot</kbd> you want to make.<br/>Craft 3 <kbd>Raw Copper</kbd> with 1 <kbd>Raw Tin</kbd> in a crafting window to obtain <kbd>Bronze Blend</kbd> - then smelt this item in a furnace to obtain a <kbd>Bronze Ingot</kbd>.

With your new bronze ingot, a new material tier opens up to you. Read on to find out about all the wonderful things you can make with bronze.

<!-- BRONZE ARMOR SECTION -->

![Bronze Armor](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_armor.png?raw=true)

<img style="float: right;" src="https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_armor_items.png?raw=true" alt="Trimmable bronze armor items">

### Bronze armor is a tier slightly above iron and below diamond.

Most pieces have the same armor value as iron, but sport 2 distinct benefits over iron:

- Bronze armor has ~16% more durability than iron
- All bronze armor pieces have [`+1 Armor Toughness`](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Armor#Armor_toughness).
- The bronze chestplate has one more armor point compared to iron

Crafting bronze armor is the same as crafting iron armor, but using Bronze Ingots instead of Iron Ingots.
<br/>Bronze armor fully supports Minecraft's new armor trimming system. Mix and match colors for the perfect set of armor.

<!-- BRONZE WEAPON SECTION -->

![Bronze Weapons](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_weapons.png?raw=true)

The bronze mod ships with 1 weapon by default, the <kbd>Bronze Sword</kbd>.<br/> This sword has 100 more durability than vanilla's iron sword, and does 0.5 more damage.<br/> This means that the bronze sword is halfway between iron and diamond in terms of damage, though the diamond sword has far greater durability.

![Bronze Weapons](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/weapons_items.png?raw=true)

The banner above shows 5 other weapons, greyed out for now. One of my other mods, [Basic Weapons](https://modrinth.com/mod/basic-weapons) adds 5 other weapon archetypes. The bronze mod will soon support integration between the two mods, adding bronze versions of every weapon Basic Weapons adds.

<!-- BRONZE TOOL SECTION -->

![Bronze Tools](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_toools.png?raw=true)

### Bronze Tools are slightly better than iron, but much worse than diamond

As you may expect, this mod adds bronze variants of all vanilla tools. These tools have stats similar to iron, but with some distinct benefits:

- Bronze tools have 350 durability instead of iron's 250
- Bronze tools are ~14% faster than iron tools
- Bronze tools have 0.5 more attack damage than iron tools
  ![Tools banner](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/tools_items.png?raw=true)

<img style="float: left;" src="https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/sickle_item.png?raw=true" alt="Sickle item">
In addition to the bronze variants of vanilla tools, a new tool joins the roster - the <kbd>Sickle</kbd>.<br/>
This item helps you manage the flora in your world. It can harvest fully-grown crops on farmland as well as short and tall grass, leaving flowers and bushes intact.<br/>The <kbd>Sickle</kbd> is the perfect item for builders, who want to clear an area of land before building, as well as farmers, who will benefit from faster crop harvests.<br/>Drops from blocks destroyed with the sickle are respected, so you will still get all those seeds from the grass you cut down.

#### Did you know: The sickle is in the same class as shears, compasses, clocks and the archaeology brush - it doesn't have different material tiers, and can subsequently only be made from bronze.

<!-- FUTURE PLANS SECTION -->

![Bronze Mod Future](https://github.com/Khazoda/bronze/blob/Web-Assets/description_common/bronze_future.png?raw=true)
The bronze mod's ethos is about giving copper a whole new avenue of utility outside of redstone and building, as well as fleshing out midgame progression for survival Minecraft. With this in mind, there are a few new features I'd like to implement in the Bronze mod going forward:
